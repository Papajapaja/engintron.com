## Third-party scripts for Engintron

### Generate domain exclusions
**By [@cpkwebsolutions](https://github.com/cpkwebsolutions)**

* Description: On one of my WHM servers, I currently have 4 ip addresses with approx 100 wordpress sites spread randomly over them. This script generates the Engintron exclusions that are needed automatically (via cron every couple of minutes).
